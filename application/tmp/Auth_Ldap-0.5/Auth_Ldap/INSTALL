=== Installation Instructions ===
1. Download this zip archive
2. Unzip to a temprorary location
3. Change into the Auth_Ldap directory
4. Recursively copy the library into your application/ directory
5. Configure the library

A typical example of this process would be:

$ cd /tmp
$ wget http://www.techrockdo.com/projects/Auth_Ldap-0.5.zip
$ unzip Auth_Ldap-0.5.zip
$ cd Auth_Ldap
$ cp -r * /path/to/your/codeigniter/install/application/
$ vim /path/to/your/codeigniter/install/application/config/auth_ldap.php

If you don't want the example views and controller, then change the 
5th step above to:
$ cp -r libraries config /path/to/your/codeigniter/install/application/

Enjoy!
